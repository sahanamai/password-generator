# password-generator
* For this assignment, Out of all the youtube videos and sites I used to do research on javascript, This was the most helpful in framing my code for my array conditions.

* If the user clicks the generate password button , it asks for a charater to enter (lenght between 8 and 128) .

* Then, uppercase, lowercase, special character and numbers are entered with user choice. the user should give any one of these characters.I uses a array concept to store all the values.

* The password is generated for the user .

* Online Sources that helped me out.
